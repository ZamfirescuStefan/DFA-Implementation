# Implementation of a lambda-nedeterministic finite automata (lambda_NFA)

The program checks if a word is accepted by a lambda_NFA.

### The DFA is read from ```"config_automat"``` file in this form: 
 - the numbers of states 
 - the number of characters in the alphabet
 - the list of characters of the alphabet
 - initial state 
 - the number of final states
 - the list of final states 
 - the number of transitions
 - the list os transitions 
  - list of transitions with ``` node evaluation node``` structure
  
  ### The word is given from the console:
  
   - First: number of characters of the word 
   - Second: the word
